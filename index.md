This workshop is targeted at researchers working with video recordings. Even though the workshop will be based on quantitative tools, the aim is to provide solutions for *qualitative* research. This includes visualization techniques such as motion videos, motion history images, and motiongrams; techniques that in  different ways allow for looking at video recordings from different temporal and spatial perspectives. It also includes some basic computer vision analysis, such as extracting quantity and centroid of motion, and using such features in analysis.

The participants will learn to use the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT), which is a collection of high-level modules for easy generating all of the above mentioned visualizations and analysis. This toolbox was originally developed for the analysis of music-related body motion (musicians, dancers and perceivers), but is equally useful for other disciplines working with video recordings of humans, such as linguistics, pedagogics, psychology, and medicine. 

This lesson has been developed by [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://people.uio.no/alexanje), University of Oslo.
